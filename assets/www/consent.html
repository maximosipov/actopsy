<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide, it
is important for you to understand why the research is being done and
what it will involve. Please take time to read the following
information carefully, and discuss it with friends and relatives if
you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you
would like more information using the phone number or email address
above. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part.
Thank you for reading this.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>What is the purpose of this study?</H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Physical activity has a strong connection to mood. Identification of mood
states has a great importance, especially for patients with affective
mood disorders. However the current clinical practice uses <I>subjective</I>
mood ratings, provided by the patients themselves. The goal of this
study is to find a method for automated identification of mood, based
on physical activity and environmental data (light exposure).
</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>What will happen if I take part?</H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY >
You will be involved in the research for about three to six months (longer
time is necessary to identify personalized activity-mood predictors)
and general assessments of your mood and activity will occur. A
detailed account of all the measures and requirements are detailed
below:
</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER ><FONT SIZE=4><B>General assessment </B></FONT></P>
<OL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<I>Questionnaires and scales</I>: We want to see how your mood
	changes throughout the period of study. For this we will ask you to
	complete questionnaires relating to your mood every day of the
	study. All questionnaires together may take approximately 5 minutes
	to complete. 
	</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<I>Activity and light:</I> Your activity and exposure to light will
	be recorded using an Android based mobile phone. For this, you will
	simply need to install the Actopsy application on you mobile phone.
	Recordings will be carried out continuously and transferred via
	Wi-Fi to our servers; they should not interfere with your normal
	life style.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Expenses and payments</H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY >Unfortunately we cannot provide compensation for participation in the study.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>What do I have to do to take part?</H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
After reading this information sheet, you may discuss the study with us or
friends and family if you wish. If you are interested in taking part
in the study we will ask you to provide informed consent prior to
starting the protocol. It makes sure that you understand the purpose
of the study and what is going to happen. After giving consent we
will begin the study, but you will be able to leave the study at any
point without having to give a reason. There is no penalty attached
to withdrawing. In order to do it, just uninstall the Actopsy
application from your mobile phone.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Benefits and risks</H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The benefits of the study include creation of more precise predictors of
mania and depression, useful in clinical practice. The risks include
increase of mobile phone power consumption and data traffic of the
phone.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>What happens to the results of the research study?</H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The University of Oxford is committed to the dissemination of its
research for the benefit of society and the economy and, in support
of this commitment, has established an online archive of research
materials. This archive includes digital copies of student theses
successfully submitted as part of a University of Oxford postgraduate
degree programme. Holding the archive online gives easy access for
researchers to the full text of freely available theses, thereby
increasing the likely impact and use of that research.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
If you agree to participate in this project, the research will be written up
as a thesis. On successful submission of the thesis, it will
deposited both in print and online in the University archives, to
facilitate its use in future research. The thesis will be published
with open access, open access meaning available to every Internet
user. We also plan to publish the results in a scientific journal and
would provide a copy of the published results upon request.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
All personal information will be kept strictly confidential; our
confidentiality practices are under the normal legal requirements.
Only researchers from the Intelligent Patient Monitoring Group of the
Institute of Biomedical Engineering will have access to the data. At
the end of the study data and test results will be anonymized and
kept on password-protected computers with a purpose of further
analysis with improved algorithms to facilitate future research.</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>Who is organising, funding and monitoring the research?</H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The research is organised by the Centre for Doctoral Training in
Healthcare Innovation and the Institute of Biomedical Engineering of
Oxford University. It is funded partly by the EPSRC and partly by the
Hill Foundation. The study is based at the Institute of Biomedical
Engineering. Neither investigators nor consultants will receive money
for recruiting you into this study. The study has been reviewed by,
and received ethics clearance through, the University of Oxford
Central University Research Ethics Committee.</P>
